# LibUDPard instructions for agents

Please read README.md for general information about LibUDPard.
The library source files are just two: `libudpard/udpard.c` and `libudpard/udpard.h`.

Keep the code and comments very brief. Be sure every significant code block is preceded with a brief comment.

When building the code, don't hesitate to use multiple jobs to use all CPU cores.
